                                        I’m calling to urge <b>Sen/Rep _____</b> to support the Voting Rights Advancement Act, legislation that will protect our vulnerable communities from suppressive voting legislation and ensure that everyone in America has a voice in our democracy. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        These laws are intentionally discriminatory on the basis of race, age, and disability and unconstitutionally disenfranchise millions of americans in these vulnerable communities. For Jeff Sessions and the Justice Department to dismiss the claim that suppressive voter laws are not crafted with the intention of discrimination is outrageous. A change in administration in no way invalidates thousands of pages of overwhelming evidence that proves this legislation deliberately suppresses minority voters. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        It is unacceptable to continue to disenfranchise voters in our democracy, and I urge <b>Sen/Rep _____</b> to support the Voting Rights Advancement act and to ensure that all voices can be heard. Thank you for your time.</p>

                                        The reality is that there hasn’t been a single case of any student pretending to be transgender to gain access to a bathroom, and the real crime is turning our backs on vulnerable students who deserve to be protected under Title IX. This discriminatory decision leaves our most vulnerable children and teenagers at an even higher risk of bullying and stigmatization, and it is heinous that the Departments of Justice and Education are turning their backs and allowing this to happen in our schools.

                                        <br><br>
                                        By failing to divest his vast global empire, President Trump’s decision making becomes increasingly compromised by organizations and entities from which he is able to receive money while holding office. The only way to ensure that President trump is not abusing the highest seat of government is to divest and place them into a blind trust, procedure that has been the standard for previous presidents. By refusing to do so, he transparently puts the his own interests above those of the American people. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        I urge <b>Sen/Rep _____</b> to support the Presidential Conflict of Interest Act and ensure that President Trump cannot continue to profit off of the office of the American Presidency. Thank you for your time.

                                        President Trump, like all modern presidents, owes the American people full disclosure of his tax returns. People have the right to know that he is not trying to hide suspicious financial ties to foreign governments that he and his cabinet are beholden to. It is imperative that he shed light on all potential conflicts of interests, provide comprehensive disclosure of his business dealings, and  and definitively ensure that he isn’t playing by his own rules.

                                        It has become indisputable fact that key members of the Trump administration, including Michael Flynn and Jeff Sessions among others, have had inappropriate communication with Russian intelligence officers both before and after the election. This is a bipartisan matter of national security and the American people deserve to know that our interests are not taking a backseat to the special interests of a foreign government that demonstrably threatens democratic western institutions across the globe.

                                        I’m calling to urge <b>Sen/Rep _____</b> to defend Obama’s environmental legacy and crucial legislation to protect our planet. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        Repealing legislation that protects against emissions in the interest of an elite few will cause unprecedented environmental catastrophe whose effects will be suffered worldwide. Furthermore, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement will not only render its crucial goals unattainable, but will embolden high emitting nations and leave little incentive to participate in the global effort to mitigate these devastating effects. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        Safeguarding the environment transcends this dangerously irresponsible conservative political agenda, and I expect <b>Sen/Rep _____</b> to take a stand a stand for our health, safety and preservation of the only planet we have to live on.

                                        <br><br>
                                        The emails demonstrate his collusion with key figures in the fossil fuel industry and his intent to severely degrade federal environmental protections in the interest of an elite few. This dangerously irresponsible agenda and clear degradation of Obama’s environmental legacy will cause unprecedented and irreversible environmental catastrophe across the globe. These emails have clearly demonstrated that we cannot trust Scott Pruitt to fairly police these he has such close ties to, and to reduce pollution and safeguard public health.

                                        The construction of these pipelines in its immediate areas desecrate sacred Native American grounds, and pose grave threats of oil spills and contaminated drinking water. These immediate effects are caused during a time we should be moving away from extracting extremely high-cost fossil fuels and investing in more sustainable and responsible sources of energy, an agenda that threatens environmental catastrophe worldwide. The economic ramifications of the worsening climate crisis show us that we should be fighting for jobs that build, not destroy the future we see for our children.

                                        <br><br>
                                        The cosmetic alterations to the original ban are a feeble attempt to redirect the racist and anti-muslim agenda to one whose primary concern is national security. This is clear recognition that the discriminatory intent of first order was not politically or legally sound. Coming after a turbulent week in the press for the Trump administration, it is obvious this new ban is also a shallow attempt to redirect the political narrative. It serves no other purpose than to instill fear and hatred, and to and write islamophobia into policy. They cannot unring the bell.

                                        I urge <b>Sen/Rep _____</b> to oppose the muslim travel ban and the new order and and to take a stand for the inclusive values that America was built upon. Thank you for your time.

                                        These tactics unfairly target undocumented immigrants who are productive and valued members of our communities, and it is outrageous to claim that any one of these members who has committed a non-serious offence qualifies for deportation. The measures of turning local police into immigration officers allows and encourages the illegal targeting of people based on race, skin color, and language, creating an atmosphere of fear that will only tear families apart and drive these immigrants further into the shadows.

                                        This racist and inhumane agenda flies in the face of American values of diversity and nondiscrimination, and I urge <b>Sen/Rep _____</b> to help protect our vulnerable immigrant communities. Thank you for your time.</p>
